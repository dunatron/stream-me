# Description

Welcome to Strongly Typed Next.js!

Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

`Course highlights:`

- Create a full stack GraphQL API and web client

- User authentication with the React Context API

- Style JSX components with Material UI themes

- Build a monorepo server with yarn workspaces

`What is a monorepo`
This is a big deal but may be overwhelming to start off with. Please do read and perhaps have a re-read later
read all about it here [What is monorepo? (and should you use it?)](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/what-is-monorepo)

`How long is this course?`

The entire course should take between two to four weeks to complete.

By the end, you'll have plenty of new skills for building full stack web applications.

`What are we building?`

We are building a simple streaming service called "Stream-me"

Our app will feature the following functionality:

Users can login or signup and create streams.

Dark mode switch to dim the lights.

Embed music, videos or social media content.

Share streaming content with embedded links.

We are not building a "live streaming" service like twitch.

We are building a service which supports sharing embedded post content.
